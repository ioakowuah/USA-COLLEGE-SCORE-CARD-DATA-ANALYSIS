# USA-COLLEGE-SCORE-CARD-DATA-ANALYSIS
U.S Department of Education has a site called College Score Card which publishes university data for public and private use in education. We used this available data for a Capstone Project using R. We posed questions and used data analytics to answer these questions. Data used can be download here: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
